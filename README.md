# Jacob-Story
An amazing story about Jacob
It was a great Saturday morning
then I woke up...
and realized that i had at least 72 hours of homework to do
so I went to sleep again
and woke up monday morning 
sooooo
rest in peace grades 2018.
but den 
out of nowhwere 
captain beans came to the rescue
he blessed me with his bean powers
and with his help i was able to fully complete...
one hour of work.
so my grades are still a rip lul.
actually i like shoes.
